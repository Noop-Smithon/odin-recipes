    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The spicy chicke-soup is a soup like any other. With meticulous preparation you get a soup that can be dished
        for different occasions. As the name goes, we know it's predominantly going to be stocked with a lot of chicken 
        and any other condiments desired. There's not a fits-it-all approach here, but I'll share my own routine.
